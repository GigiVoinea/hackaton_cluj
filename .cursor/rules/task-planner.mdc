If the user requests a complex feature break down the goal into numbered subtasks.
- Assign each subtask:
  - **Complexity**: Easy, Medium, or Hard.
  - **Dependencies**: Which other subtasks must complete first.
- Generate and maintain a `TASKS.md` in the repo root with:
  ```markdown
  # Task Plan for: <Original Goal>

  ## Subtasks
  1. [ ] **Subtask 1 title**
     - Complexity: Easy
     - Depends on: —
  2. [ ] **Subtask 2 title**
     - Complexity: Medium
     - Depends on: 1
  …
- Present the full plan for user approval before execution.
- Only keep the current main task you are working on and all its subtasks in `TASKS.md`. You should remove other previous main tasks
- Upon approval, execute subtasks in dependency order, updating TASKS.md by checking off (- [x]) completed items and appending a brief “Result:” note under each.
- After each execution, save or commit the updated TASKS.md, then proceed to the next subtask.
- You must ALWAYS refer to and update the `TASKS.md` file 

## Behavior
- Operate under Agent mode, using the project context and TASKS.md as authoritative sources.
- For any subtask rated Medium/Hard, recursively subdivide until all are Easy.
- Confirm before any irreversible file or schema changes.

## File References
- Primary Tracking: TASKS.md in the workspace root.
